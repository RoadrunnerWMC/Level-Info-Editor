# Level Info Editor 1.7

----------------------------------------------------------------

Level Info Editor is a program which can edit and save copies of LevelInfo.bin from Newer Super Mario Bros. Wii.

**Note:** World names as seen on the HUD and in the file select menu are not loaded from LevelInfo.bin. They are stored in the world map files themselves, and can be edited with Koopatlas. (The "Yoshi's Island" text displayed on a brand-new savefile slot is an exception; for technical reasons, this string is hardcoded.) To fully modify world names, you'll need to edit them in those places, too. [See this page for more details.](https://horizon.miraheze.org/wiki/Editing_World_Names)

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Getting Started

If you're using a source release:

- Python 3 (3.10 or newer recommended) — https://www.python.org
- PyQt 6.4 (or newer) (`pip install PyQt6`) **(RECOMMENDED)** or PyQt5 (`pip install PyQt5`)

If you have a prebuilt/frozen release (for Windows, macOS or Ubuntu),
you don't need to install anything — all the required libraries are included.


### macOS Troubleshooting

If you get the error "Level Info Editor is damaged and can't be opened.",
it's because the release builds are unsigned. To fix it, launch a Terminal
window and run

    sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine "/path/to/Level Info Editor.app"

...with the example path above replaced with the actual path to the app. This
will override the application signature requirement, which should allow you to
launch the app.
